         Discussion:
      </h3>
      <p>
         <br>
         There are currently many different interchange formats that are being
         used by amateur radio today. By far the most popular is<a href= 
         "http://www.hosenose.com/adif">ADIF (Amateur Data Interchange
         Format)</a>&nbsp;for good 
reason. It is a very elegant, robust, and easy to read as raw data. It has many 
of the features found in XML without the need for special libraries and their 
associated learning curve. Having said that <STRONG>ADIF</STRONG> does have a 
short coming. It doesn't have any concept of record type. Discussions with the 
ADIF development&nbsp;reflector hasn't been fruitful. Therefore to meet the 
requires of this TrustedQSL/LoTW projects the standard must be forked. The new 
standard will be called <STRONG>Gabbi</STRONG>           
                       
                  
                     
                  
                   (Global
         Amateur Interchange) . It is hoped that the two standards will be merged
         at some point in the future. Therefore a design goal is for Gabbi format
         to be backward compatible with ADIF. This turns out to
         be fairly easy to do by declaring the QSO/Logbook record
         as the default record type.&nbsp; The QSO record type will use the standard already
         defined by ADIF.

         Requirements:
      </h3>
<UL>
         <li>
            Record
            Type Field. This field will determine the record 
  type 
         <li>
            An algorithm for determining the signing order of the 
  fields must conform to canonical parse rules.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
         <li>
            In addition the currently define QSO/Logbook record, 
  QSL and Station Records must be defined. 
         <li>
            Field definitions is only significant to that 
  record.&nbsp; For example a GRID_SQUARE field on a QSO would refer to the 
  contact station grid square.&nbsp; GRID_SQUARE on a station record would refer 
  to the grid square of the station submitting the QSL 
         <li>
            A new field or possibly as well define virtual field (ie: call and
            number of seconds since epoch) which can be common to all records
            and required for tCONTACT records will be the GUID
            (<strong>G</strong>lobal<strong>U</strong>nique<strong>ID</strong>entifier).&nbsp; This is in order that 
  different records can be uniquely connected to other records in a portable and 
  database independent way. 
         <li>
            C/C++ functions that parse and create record strings.
         </li></UL>

<H3>New Terms:</H3>
<P><STRONG>tCONTACT</STRONG> - Trusted Contact Record.&nbsp; This record 
contains on the information about the contact and a pointer to the tSTATION 
record. </P>
<P><STRONG>tQSL</STRONG> - A Trusted QSL is a match set of&nbsp;a tSTATION
