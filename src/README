Trusted QSL (tQSL) library
2001-06-04 J. Bloom, KE3Z

THIS IS VERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS!

To build this library you'll need to have the OpenSSL library
(www.openssl.org).

NOTE: Part of this library is exported from a separate source tree
used in LOTW server development. That accounts for some of the
weirdness you'll see in the source files.

BUILD
=====
Linux/Unix
----------
./configure [--with-openssl=DIR]
make -f Makefile.lib

This will make the library (libtqsllib.a) and a simple test
program, test_openssl. If the OpenSSL files aren't where the
compiler can find them, use the -with-openssl option to specify
the openssl base directory, whcih should contain lib and
include directories. Example:
   ./configure --with-openssl=/usr/local

Windows
-------
The library is built and tested under MinGW. To build it, you
need to install MinGW and use it to build the OpenSSL library.
You also need MSYS (available from the MinGW site) or a similar
environment. With that, you can follow the instructions given
above under Linux/Unix. A DLL will also be created. It will
contain the exported symbols that are extern in tqsllib.h

TESTING
=======
./test_openssl

Running the test will cause a bunch of messages to be sent to
stdout. A test cert store and key store will also be created in
$HOME/.tqsl.

DOCUMENTATION
=============
API documentation can be found in the doxygen directory. You can
rebuild the documentation by simply running doxygen using the
Doxyfile configuration file.
