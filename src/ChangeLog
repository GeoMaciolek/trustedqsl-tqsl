TQSLLIB changes
===============

2.0
---
The Windows DLL has changed to use __stdcall. This makes it
incompatible with previous versions of the DLL, necessitating
a change in major version number.

openssl 0.9.6 or 0.9.7 is now required; earlier versions are
not supported.

1.6
---
Fixed a bug in the .p12 file generation under openssl 0.9.7.
Thanks to Kenji 'Joe' Rikitake, JJ1BDX for the fix.

Fixed a bug in tqsl_get_cert_ext that under some circumstances
caused return of unterminated strings.

1.5
---
Added MacOS support.
Converted build scripts to make full use of autoconf/automake.
Fixed some GCC 3.x compiler warnings.

1.4
---
Fixed bug in ADIF converter where input file wasn't being opened in
binary mode.

Several error conditions in tqsl_getConverterGABBI caused the converter
to loop on the same erroneous record.

1.3
---
Fixed a bug in the comparison of configuration file version numbers.
Added tqsl_verifyDataBlock function.

1.2
---
Added tqsl_getSatellite and tqsl_getPropagationMode config
