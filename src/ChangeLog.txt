TQSLLIB changes
===============

2.3
---
Add a mechanism to the location definition process to allow enforcement
of proper zone number combinations. A status message is returned to allow
the caller to report illogical selections.

Duplicate checking database. No changes necessary for exising code. However
new or updated code is strongly encouraged to enable duplicate checking
and commit or discard a particular signing instance as appropriate

tqsllib now built with MSVC on Windows. ABI compatility with the previous
MinGW-built version is maintained.

tqsllib and the rest of TrustedQSL now built with the CMake build system

Fixed several bugs, crashes, and potential vulnerabilities

** Windows 98 support has been dropped. This will be one of the last releases
to support Windows 2000. 

** This will be one of the last releases to support OS X on PowerPC systems.

2.2
---
Fixed bug in handling of certificates with
long serial numbers (typically root certs).

Added workaround for OpenSSL 1.0a bug.

2.1
---
Prompt user to save their certificate after importing a .tq6 signed certificate.

outputting the correct county name in the station data exported with a signed
log.

Force proper zones for entities, states when possible.

Update configuration file to correspond to ADIF specifications for county names.

Ignore expired certificates during import/export when an expired CA
certificate is signed by a valid root cert.

Support OpenSSL 0.9 through 1.0 beta.

Fix security bug in certificate validation.

2.0
---
The Windows DLL has changed to use __stdcall. This makes it
incompatible with previous versions of the DLL, necessitating
a change in major version number.

openssl 0.9.6 or 0.9.7 is now required; earlier versions are
not supported.

1.6
---
Fixed a bug in the .p12 file generation under openssl 0.9.7.
Thanks to Kenji 'Joe' Rikitake, JJ1BDX for the fix.

Fixed a bug in tqsl_get_cert_ext that under some circumstances
caused return of unterminated strings.

1.5
---
Added MacOS support.
Converted build scripts to make full use of autoconf/automake.
Fixed some GCC 3.x compiler warnings.

1.4
---
Fixed bug in ADIF converter where input file wasn't being opened in
binary mode.

Several error conditions in tqsl_getConverterGABBI caused the converter
to loop on the same erroneous record.

1.3
---
Fixed a bug in the comparison of configuration file version numbers.
Added tqsl_verifyDataBlock function.

1.2
---
Added tqsl_getSatellite and tqsl_getPropagationMode config
functions.

Added support for conversion of ADIF BAND_RX, FREQ_RX, PROP_MODE
and SAT_NAME fields.

ADIF converter was rejecting BAND field > 5 characters, but the
valid 1.25cm value is 6 characters long.
