TrustedQSL SDK

What is?

It is an open software digital signature scheme to sign amateur
radio QSL cards.  It uses OpenSSL (www.openssl.org) crypto
DSA library to create the digital signatures.  I picked openssl
because it is portable and falls under the LGPL license which
means that software authors that use tqsl library DOES NOT
have to release source code.  

The size of a cert which includes the public key is 358 bytes.
The size of a signedQSL is around 1k.  This means that more than
a 1000 signed trusted QSL could be stored on a single floppy.


Currently working:

qgenkey - This will create a public/private key pair.

gencert - This will create a cert for the public key.  To be used
only by CA's.  Still needs issue/expiration date functions.

chkcert - This validate a cert.  Can be used by anyone to validate
a public cert.

TODO list (not in order):

1. Make sure that Microsoft C++ will compile and like.

2. Make a DLL useable by other languages other than Microsoft C++.

3. Clean up functions.

4. Add signing and validation functions (not hard because the
	certs is just a special form of signing and validation.

5. Get it into hands of software developers.

6. Need portable and secure key rings.

7. Need design and user guides

8. Needs award sponsors and software developers participation
in setting standard formats.
