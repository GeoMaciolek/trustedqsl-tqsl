TQSL/TQSLCERT changes
=====================

1.14.2
------
Fixed an error when the TrustedQSL directory had Unicode characters, don't prompt
for updates when called silently, fail properly when the user chooses to not ignore
signing errors

1.14.1
------
Minor bug fixes to internet functions and the command line parser, hang fixed
on OSX, removed unnecessary field from upload

1.14
----
Major feature additions:

 - Upload log files directly from TrustedQSL! Simply choose "sign and upload"
   from the File menu and your log will signed and uploaded automatically with
   no extra work.

 - Command line flag '-u' has been added to expose this functionality to
   tools authors.
 - The return value from tqsl can be used to determine whether the signing
   or upload succeeded or failed, and why

          0=success; log signed and uploaded and accepted without incident
	  1=Cancelled by user
	  2=The log was rejected by the LoTW server
          3=The response from the LoTW server was unexpected or unrecognized
          4=An error occurred in tqsl
          5=An error occurred in tqsllib (probably a bad filename)
	  6=Unable to open input file
	  7=Unable to open output file
	  8=All QSOs were duplicate or out of date range (no QSOs written)
	  9=Some QSOs were duplicate or out of date range (some QSOs written)
	  10=Command syntax error
	  11=LoTW network connection failed (no network or LoTW is unreachable)

   The exit status is also written to Standard Error (stderr) in an easily
   recognized format.

 - Automatically check for updates. If a new version is available, you will be
   periodically prompted to download and install it. You can also check manually

 - Duplicate checking. Any QSOs that have been successfully uploaded to Logbook
   of the World or saved to a file are registered in a database. Any exact
   duplicates are automatically stripped from future logs. This can be disabled
   on a case-by-case basis, in case a log was signed but never uploaded, or
   there was a server issue that led to an upload going unprocessed.

 - TQSL will now ensure that the CQ and ITU zones, and subdivisions if any
   (US state/county, Canadian province, Russian oblast) are valid with respect
   to each other. This should reduce the incidence of swapped CQ/ITU zones and
   in general should help ensure that more accurate location data is uploaded.
   When an attempt is made to use a location with errors (such as CQ/ITU
   zones being reversed) the user is notified to correct the errors.

 - Installer on Windows is now a Microsoft Windows Installer package, instead of
   an executable. This will allow for easier and cleaner upgrades

 - Added a new command line option, '-a', to allow command line users to
   control user interaction. This option takes a value from the set ask,
   abort, compliant, or all. For '-a ask', TQSL will ask users how to handle
   duplicates and date mismatches. '-a abort' will cause signing to terminate
   immediately when an error occurs. '-a compliant' will cause only correct
   (new or in date range) records to be output, and '-a all' will cause all
   of the input records (including duplicates) to be signed. Prompts for errors
   (date ranges bad, bad callsigns) will be suppressed for '-a compliant'
   or '-a all', but cause immediate aborts when '-a abort' is used. '-a ask'
   prompts the user in those cases.

Minor changes:

 - TQSL/TQSLCERT now have window icons

 - Double-clicking an entry in the "Choose station location" window for signing
   now selects it, instead of opening it for editing

 - Command line parsing has been rewritten and should be more robust. Also,
   command-line documentation is available with '-h'

 - Files to sign and save are now prompted before location and date range

 - The build number is now shown in the About box; please include this when
   asking for help

 - The final confirmation before signing includes the signing station location

 - Output files on Unix systems are provided with a default .tq8 extension

 - The "Edit station location" window title now contains the callsign and
   station location name

 - Station locations can no longer be defined using expired or superceded
   certificates

 - Users are no longer prompted for a password while importing a .p12 file
   unless the file has a password set

 - When importing a certificate, detailed information is provided on the
   progress of the operation as well as the reason for any errors

 - Dozens of bug fixes and potential or real crashes fixed.

TQSL/TQSLCERT and the rest of TrustedQSL now built with the CMake build system

TQSL/TQSLCERT are now built with MSVC on Windows.

** Windows 98 support has been dropped. This will be one of the last releases
to support Windows 2000.

** This will be one of the last releases to support OS X on PowerPC systems.
