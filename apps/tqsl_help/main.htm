<H3>TQSL Utility</H3>
<P>
The <i>TQSL</i> utility program is used to prepare files for
the <a href="tqsl.htm"><I>TrustedQSL</i></a> system.
<P>
<I>TQSL</I> requires an input log file in either <A HREF="glossary.htm#adif">ADIF</a>
or <A HREF="glossary.htm#cabrillo">Cabrillo</a> format. Many logging programs
can export log data in one or the other of these formats. <I>TQSL</I> also provides a rudimentary
QSO data editor that can be used to create small ADIF files.
See <A HREF="qsodata.htm"><b>Managing QSO Data</b></a>.
<P>
Along with the QSO data in the log file, <I>TQSL</I> needs to know your station location.
<I>TQSL</I> provides a mechanism to describe one or more station locations and save them for
association with log files. (Even if information is present in the log file that describes
your station location, it isn't used by <i>TQSL</i>.) See <A HREF="stnloc.htm"><b>Managing Station
Locations</b></A>.
<P>
Once you have prepared a log file and specified the station location, you are ready
to <i>sign</i> the data, which produces a TrustedQSL file containing the digitally
signed records, ready to be sent to their destination, such as ARRL's <I>Logbook
of the World</i> system. See <A HREF="signing.htm"><b>Preparing TrustedQSL Files (Signing)</b></a>.
<P>
<I>TQSL</I> has several configuration options you can set. See <A HREF="pref.htm"><b>Preferences</b></a>.
