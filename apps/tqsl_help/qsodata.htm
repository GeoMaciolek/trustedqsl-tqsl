<H3>Managing QSO Data</H3>
<P>
<I>TQSL</I> contains a simple ADIF file creator and editor that can be used to
create small files that can then be signed as <i>TrustedQSL</i> files.

<TR><TD><B>N.B.</B> The QSO Data editor in <I>TQSL</I> is quite
rudimentary, intended only as a means for those who do not
have access to a full-featured logging program to create
TrustedQSL files. The QSO Data editor
handles only the most critical QSO data fields. If you
load an ADIF file created by a logging program into the <I>TQSL</I>
QSO Data editor, then save the file, fields of the records
will likely be lost in the editing process.
<P>
Bottom line: Don't use the QSL Data editor to edit a file
generated by a logging program. Or if you do, save the
file into a new ADIF file, leaving the original file intact.
