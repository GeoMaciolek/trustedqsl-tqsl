<H3>Preferences - Options</H3>
<P>
This tab lets you set several options:

<P>
There is no absolute standard for the file extensions (.XXX) used
for Cabrillo and ADIF files. Several <i>de facto</i> extensions are in use.
<P>
TQSL lets you specify the extensions used on your system for the different
file types. This is useful when you select the <B>Sign existing ADIF or Cabrillo file</B>
choice from the <B>File</B> menu, as you can then select which kinds of file to show in
the file selection dialog.
<P>
In the example shown above, files whose names end in &quot;.log&quot; or &quot;.cab&quot;
will be treated as Cabrillo files, while those with names ending in &quot;.adi&quot; or
&quot;.ADI&quot; are ADIF files. (On a system such as <I>Windows</I> that doesn't distinguish
case in file names, the two ADIF entries would be unneccessary.)
<P>
The <B>Options</b> tab also provides a checkbox that allows you to choose whether TQSL
should treat a nonamateur call-worked as an error. Some systems (notably ARRL's <i>Logbook
of the World</i>) will not allow nonamateur call signs to be entered. By default, this
box is unchecked, and nonamateur call signs are treated as errors. (Note: The check for
nonamateur call signs is rudimentary. It's possible to get a call sign that is not a
valid ITU identification past the check, but most common logging errors will be caught.)
<P>
Another checkbox allows you to select whether <i>TQSL</i> should prompt you for a QSO date
range when signing an existing ADIF or Cabrillo file. (This is on by default.) See
<A HREF="daterng.htm">Setting a Signing Date Range</A> for details.
