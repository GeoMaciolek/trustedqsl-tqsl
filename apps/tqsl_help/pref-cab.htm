<P>
The Cabrillo contest log file format varies depending on the particular contest.
TQSL needs to know which field of the QSO line entry contains the call sign of
the station that was worked. (Details of the Cabrillo format can be found at
http://www.kkn.net/~trey/cabrillo/) It also needs to know whether the contest
is an HF or VHF-and-above contest so that the frequency field of the Cabrillo
file can be properly interpreted.
<P>
For ARRL contests and many other popular contests, TQSL already knows this information.
For less popular contests, you may need to provide the information via the <B>Cabrillo Specs</B>
tab. This also comes in handy if your logging software doesn't output the contest data
correctly, or if the CONTEST name in the Cabrillo file is incorrect in some way, since
the <B>Cabrillo Spec</B> entries override any built-in contest informartion.
<P>
A list of Cabrillo contest specifications is displayed:

<P>
In this example, a Cabrillo file that contains <I>DL-DX-RTTY</I> in the CONTEST line
will be treated as an HF contest that contains the call sign worked in field 8 of
each QSO line. A Cabrillo file with a contest name of <I>JIDX-CW</I> is also an HF contest
that contains the call sign worked in field 8.
<P>
To delete an entry, select it by clicking on the entry in the list, then select <b>Delete</b>.
<P>
To add an entry, select <b>Add</b> to get the <B>Add Contest</b> dialog:

<P>
Type in the contest name as it will appear in the CONTEST line of the Cabrillo file.
Check <B>HF<b> or <b>VHF</b> as appropriate (VHF includes UHF and microwave contests).
Enter the field number of the call sign worked field. Fields are numbered with 1 being
the first field after the &quot;QSO:&quot; line tag. For example:
<PRE>
QSO: 21042 CW 1997-11-01 2101 N5KO     1 B 74 SCV WA2VRR   1 A 74 VA
</PRE>
In this ARRL Sweepstakes log line the call sign worked (WA2VRR) appears in field 10.
