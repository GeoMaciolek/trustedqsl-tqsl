<H3>Setting a Signing Date Range</H3>
<P>
During signing you may wish to restrict the QSO date range. If you do, any
QSOs that fall outside the date range (before the start date or after the
end date) will not be signed or included in the output TQSL file.

<P>
Dates should be entered in YYYY-MM-DD format.
<P>
You may leave either date blank, in which case only the other date is checked.
For example, if you set the start date to 2002-01-01 and left the end date
blank, any QSO dated 2002-01-01 or later would be signed. QSOs dated earlier
than 2002-01-01 would be ignored.
<P>
If QSOs in the input ADIF or Cabrillo file fell outside the date range,
<i>TQSL</i> will report at the end of signing how many QSO records were skipped.
<P>
Display of the QSO Date Range dialog can be suppressed via <a href="pref-opt.htm">Preferences</a>.
