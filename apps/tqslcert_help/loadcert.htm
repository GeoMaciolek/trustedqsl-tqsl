<H3>Loading a Certificate File</H3>
<P>
Once a certificate has been issued by the certificate provider
it must be loaded into your system by choosing <b>Load Certificate File</b>
from the <b>File</b> menu.
<P>
While the file is being loaded, information about the certificates
being loaded may be displayed. If this is not the first certificate loaded into the system,
you may receive warnings about duplicate certificates; this is normal.
