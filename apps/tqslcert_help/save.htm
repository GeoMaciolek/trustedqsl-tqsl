<H3>Save Certificate</H3>
<P>
When you select a certificate and choose the <B>Certificate</b> menu <b>Save</b> command,
you save the selected certificate and its private key to a PKCS#12 file. That file can
be loaded into <i>tQSLCert</i> later using the <b>File</b> menu <b>Load Certificate File</b> command.
(PKCS#12 is a standard format for containing digital certificates, so the saved file can also
be loaded into other PKCS#12 compliant systems, such as Microsoft <i>Windows</i>.)
<P>
You will first be presented with a file selection dialog, allowing you to specify
the name of the file to save to.
<P>
Once you have chosen the file, you specify the password that will be used to protect
the PKCS#12 file.

<P>
It's wise to protect the file with a password. If you do not, anyone
who gains posession of the file will be able to use the included certificate and private
key to create digital signatures using your identity. You can choose not to use a
password, but <I>you are responsible for keeping your private information private!</i>
<P>
<I>Note:</I> If the private key for the certificate you are saving is password protected,
you will have to supply the password to <a href="unlock.htm">unlock the key</a> so it can be saved in the PKCS#12
file. If needed, you will be prompted to supply the password.
<P>
<I>Note:</I> The saved PKCS#12 file contains only a single certificate. If you have
more than one certificate, you should save each one to a separate PKCS#12 file.
