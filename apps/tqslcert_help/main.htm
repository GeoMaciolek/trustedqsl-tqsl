<a href="tqsl.htm"><i>TrustedQSL</i></a> and systems that use it, such as ARRL's <I>Logbook
of the World</i>, rely on <i>digital certificates</i> for security. To participate in a
<I>TrustedQSL</I> system, you must obtain a certificate accepted by that system. The
<i>tQSLCert</i> program is used to generate requests for digital certificates and to
store the resulting received digital certificates. The steps to obtaining a certificate are:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI> Use <i>tQSLCert</i> to <a href="crq.htm">generate a certificate request fil</a>e.
	<LI> <a href="crqsend.htm">Send the certificate request</a> file to the organization that issues certificates for
		the system you wish to use.
	<LI> Receive the issued certificate back from the issuer in a file.
	<LI> <a href="loadcert.htm">Load the certificate file</a> into <i>tQSLCert</i>.
</UL>
<P>
The main window of <i>tQSLCert</i> shows the certificates that are available. When a <A HREF="crq.htm">certificate
request</a> has been created but the accompanying certificate has not yet been loaded into <i>tQSLCert</i>,
the certificate will be displayed with this icon: <img src="nocert.bmp" width=16 height=16 hspace=3 vspace=2 border=0>
<P>
If there is a problem with the certificate, it will be displayed with the broken-certificate
icon: <img src="broken-cert.bmp" width=16 height=16 hspace=3 vspace=2 border=0>
