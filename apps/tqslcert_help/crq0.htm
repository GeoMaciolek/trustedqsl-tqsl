<H3>Generating a Certificate Request - Call, DXCC and QSO Dates</H3>
<P>
The first page asks for the call sign, DXCC entity and QSO date range.
<P>
Ideally, the <i>QSO begin date</i> should be set to the date you first held this
call sign. Practically, the QSO date must be on or before the date of the
earliest QSO you wish to submit using this certificate.
<P>
For call signs that are no longer held,the <i>QSO end date</i> should be the
expiration date of the license (or at least on or after the date of the last QSO you
wish to submit). For currently held call signs, the <i>QSO end date</i> should
normally be left blank; the certificate issuer will set it equal to the certificate's
expiration date. But if the license is due for expiration and will not be renewed,
you may place the license expiration date in the <i>QSO end date</i>.
