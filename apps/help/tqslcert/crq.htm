<H3>Generating a Certificate Request</H3>
<P>
A certificate request is generated when you choose <b>New Certificate Request</b>
from the <b>File</b> menu.
<P>
To create the certificate request, you must supply information about:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI> The issuer you expect to issue the certificate.
	<LI> The call sign this certificate will be used for.
	<LI> The DXCC entity that QSOs signed with this certificate will credit.
	<LI> Your name and postal address.
	<LI> Your email address.
</UL>
<P>
In addition, certificate requests may be <a href="glossary.htm#signing">signed</a> with an exisiting certificate
if one is available.
<P>
A certificate request is generated via a &quot;wizard&quot; that takes you through the process
step-by-step, displaying pages of information fields for you to fill in.
<P>
The first step of the wizard asks you to select the certificate issuer to which you will
send this certificate request. (There may be only one issuer listed.)
