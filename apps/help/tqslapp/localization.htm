<p>In TQSL 2.1, the text that appears in TQSL's windows, dialogs, and error messages can be presented in English, French, Italian, Japanese, German, Portuguese, or Spanish. Translations were accomplished using Google Translate, 
and thus would benefit from improvements by fluent speakers. </p>

If you'd like to help improve one or more translations,
