<H3>Preferences - ADIF Modes</H3>
<P>
The ADIF MODE field is defined by the ADIF specification to have only a particular
set of mode values. These values are not exactly the same as the mode values
supported by TrustedQSL, but TQSL knows about that and will map defined ADIF modes to
the appropriate TrustedQSL modes automatically.
<P>
However, many logging programs do not restrict the contents of the MODE field to the
values listed in the ADIF specification. To handle that problem, the <b>ADIF Modes</b>
tab of the <B>Preferences</B> dialog lets you map a MODE field value to one of the valid
TrustedQSL modes.
<P>
A list of mappings is displayed, showing the present mappings. For example:
<P>
<img src="pref-adi.bmp" width=363 height=370 border=0>
<P>
In this example, when <I>BPSK</I> appears in the MODE field of an ADIF record during
signing, <i>PSK31</i> will be output in the TrustedQSL file. Similarly, a mode of
<i>MCW</i> will be output as <I>CW</I>.
<P>
To delete a mapping, click on the list entry to select it, then choose <B>Delete</b>.
<P>
To add a mapping, choose <B>Add</B> to get the <b>Add ADIF Mode Dialog</b>:
<P>
<img src="adifdial.bmp" width=266 height=282 border=0>
<P>
Type the ADIF mode into the <B>ADIF Mode</B> field. Then select the desired TrustedQSL
mode from the list and choose <B>OK</B>.
