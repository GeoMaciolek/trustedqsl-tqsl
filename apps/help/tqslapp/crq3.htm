<H3>Generating a Certificate Request - Password</H3>
<P>
You may password-protect the private key for this certificate. If you do, you will have to provide the password
each time the certificate is used for digital signing. It is recommended to password-protect the key so that
someone gaining access to your computer (physically or via a network) cannot use your certificate for digital
signing without knowing the password.
<P>
If you choose to use a password, be sure you remember it or write it down and keep it somewhere safe. There is
is no practical way of recovering your password if you forget it! In particular, the certificate issuer does
<i>not</i> know your password and cannot help if you forget it!
<P>
If you choose not to use a password, simply leave the password fields blank.
