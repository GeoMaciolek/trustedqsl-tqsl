<H3>Preparing TrustedQSL Files (Signing)</H3>
<P>
Once you've defined a station location you are ready to sign QSO records for that location.
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=10 CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR="#E0E0FF">
<TR><TD><B>N.B.</B> All of the records in the ADIF or Cabrillo file
you wish to sign must be for QSOs from the same station location using
the same call sign. If the file contains records from multiple locations
or made using multiple call signs, use your logging software
(or text editor) to change the file or create a new one that contains
records from only one station location and call sign.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Use the <B>File</B> menu's <B>Sign existing ADIF or Cabrillo file</B> command to convert an existing ADIF or
Cabrillo QSO data file to a TrustedQSL file. The first step is to select the station
location that matches the contents of the QSO data file:

<I>TQSL</I> will then prompt you to identify the names of the input and output
files. Once you have done that, you'll be asked to confirm the signing operation:

If you have elected to be prompted for the QSO date range, that will happen before
the first QSO record is processed. See
<A HREF="daterng.htm">Setting a Signing Date Range</A> for details.
<P>
After the operation is complete, <I>TQSL</I> will display the result:
