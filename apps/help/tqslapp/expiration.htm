<p>
Callsign Certificates are valid for 3 years. To determine when a Callsign Certificate will expire, 

<table border="0" valign="top">
	<col style="width:30px">
	<tr><td>1.</td><td>Start the <b>TQSLCert</b> application; the <b>tQSL Certificates</b> window will appear, displaying a list of your Callsign Certificates</td></tr>
	<tr><td>2.</td><td>Right-click the Callsign Certificate in question, and select <b>Properties</b> from the pop-up menu that appears; a <b>Certificate Properties</b> window will display the Certificate's expiration date</td></tr>
	<tr><td>3.</td><td>Terminate <b>TQSLCert</b> by opening its <b>File</b> menu and selecting the <b>Exit</b> command</td></tr>
</table>

<p>
You will typically receive an email notification from the ARRL a few weeks before your certificate expires.
