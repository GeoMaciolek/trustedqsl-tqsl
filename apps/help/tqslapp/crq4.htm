<H3>Generating a Certificate Request - Signing</H3>
<P>
If this is an additional certificate request -- meaning you've alredy received at least one certificate -- you
may sign your certificate request using an existing certificate.
<P>
Issuers may require that additional certificate requests from the same individual be signed, or there may
be an advantage in signing your request. For example, In ARRL's <I>Logbook of the World</I> system, a signed
request may not require that you provide supporting documentation, whereas an unsigned request does. Also, in LOTW
signing the certificate request associates the new certificate with the one used for signing so that all of
the submissions made with the certificates can be accessed via the same Web site user account.
<P>
In general, if you <i>can</i> sign a request, you should.
<P>
To sign your requst, simply select the certificate to use for signing by clicking on it.
If the certificate's private key is password protected, you'll have to <a href="unlock.htm">supply the
password</a> after selecting <B>Next</B>.
