<H3>Managing Station Locations</H3>
<P>
A station location describes the call sign, geographic location and
political subdivisions of a particular station operation. Station locations are tied
to digital cerificates, which in turn contain the station call sign and DXCC entity. There
may be more than one station location for a particular call-sign/dxcc-entity, allowing for
portable and mobile operation. (Note that in the context of TrustedQSL, call signs such
as KE3Z and KE3Z/7 are treated as two separate call signs, each of which must have its
own digital certificate to be used for signing QSO data files for the respective call sign.)
<P>
When you elect to sign a file, <I>TQSL</I> displays a station-location dialog
that lets you select an existing station location or add a new one. You also can
edit or delete an existing station location from this dialog. (Adding new station
locations can also be done via the <b>Station</b> menu.)
