<H3>Sending a Certificate Request</H3>
<P>
The end result of <a href="crq.htm">generating</a> a certificate request
is a certificate-request file. This file must be sent to the <i>TrustedQSL</i>
certificate issuer, who will then issue a digital certificate.
<P>
<i>tQSLCert</i> will display a message box telling you where to send the
request file for the selected issuer.
<P>
You also should <a href="save.htm">save the certificate</a> (which so far consists of only the
private key) onto a backup medium (floppy disk, CD-R, etc) in case your
system crashes and the certificate data is lost.
<P>
Once the issuer responds to your certificate request by sending the issued
certificate, you must <a href="loadcert.htm">load the received TQSL (.tq6) certificate file</a> to
make the certificate ready for use.
<P>
