<H3>Loading a Certificate File - Private Key Password Entry</H3>
<P>
When you load a PKCS#12 file it may contain a private key. Just as is the case when a
private key is generated during the certificate-request process, you have the option of
password protecting the private key so that the password will have to be entered each
time the key is used for signing.

It's a good idea to use a password on your private keys, but you are not required to
do so. If you leave the password fields blank and select <b>Ok</b>, the key will
be stored unprotected, without a password.
<P>
Once you have selected <b>Ok</b> the <a href="lcf1.htm">results0</a> of the loading will be displayed.
