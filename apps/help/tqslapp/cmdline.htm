<H3>Command Line Interface</H3>
<P>
When starting TQSL, you may specify command line options that 
<UL>
<LI>initiate the definition or editing of a <A HREF="glossary.htm#station_location">Station Location</A></LI>
<LI>initiate the <A HREF="glossary.htm#signed_log_file">signing of a log file</A>
<LI>direct that a signed log file be uploaded to LoTW via the internet</LI>
</UL>
Most command line options are single-letter switches, some of which require an argument; such arguments should be separated from the switch letter by one or more spaces. Arguments that
contain spaces or other shell-special characters should be quoted in a manner suitable for the
operating system and shell that's being used. If more than one command line switch is specified, each switch must be 
separated from the preceding switch by one or more spaces.
<P>
A filename not preceded by a switch is assumed to be the name of a log file whose QSOs are to be signed.
<P>
After taking the actions specified by command line options, TQSL will enter its menu-driven mode of operation unless the <code>-q</code> or <code>-x</code>
switch is present, in which case it will terminate.

<TR><TD><B>Option</B></TD><TD><B>Description</B></TD></TR>

<TR><TD><code>-a</code></TD>
<TD>The action to be taken if a duplicate or out-of-date-range QSO is encountered while signing a log file's QSOs:<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>-a ask&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>a dialog will be provided that prompts the user to specify how to proceed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>-a abort&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>no QSOs will be signed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>-a compliant&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>neither duplicate QSO nor out-of-date-range QSOs will be signed; all other QSOs will be signed<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>-a all&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</code>all QSOs, including duplicates and out-of-date-range QSOs, will be signed<P>
If no <code>-a</code> switch is specified and a duplicate or out-of-date-range QSO is encountered while signing QSOs, a dialog will be provided that prompts the user to specify how to proceed.
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><code>-d</code></TD>
<TD>Suppress the date-range dialog; if this switch is present, the <A HREF="daterng.htm">QSO date-range dialog</A> will <i>not</i>
be displayed before signing a log.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><code>-h</code></TD>
<TD>Display command line help.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><code>-l&nbsp;Station_Location</code></TD>
<TD>Select a defined <A HREF="glossary.htm#station_location">Station Location</A> to be used when signing log files. If the specified Station Location contains embedded spaces, it must be 
quoted in a manner suitable for the operating system and shell that's being used. If the specified Station Location doesn't exist, no QSOs will be signed or uploaded unless <code>-s</code> is also specified. 
If <code>-l</code> is not present and a log file is being signed, a dialog will be provided that prompts the user to select a Station Location.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><code>-o&nbsp;Filename</code></TD>
<TD>Specify the name of the <A HREF="glossary.htm#signed_log_file">digitally signed log file</A> to be created. If the specified Filename contains embedded spaces, it must be 
quoted in a manner suitable for the operating system and shell that's being used. If <code>-o</code> is not present, the specified log filename with its extension set to <code>.tq8</code> will be used.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><code>-p&nbsp;Password</code></TD>
<TD>Specify the password that gains access to a password-protected Callsign Certificate when <A HREF="glossary.htm#signed_log_file">signing a log file</A>. If the specified Password contains 
embedded spaces or other shell-special characters, it must be 
quoted in a manner suitable for the operating system and shell that's being used. If <code>-p</code> is not present, a log file is being signed,
and the specified or selected Station Location includes a password-protected Callsign Certificate, a dialog will be provided that prompts the user to specify the password.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><code>-q</code></TD>
<TD>Operate in batch mode: error messages and return codes will be routed to STDERR, and TQSL will terminate after taking the actions specified by command line options.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><code>-s</code></TD>
<TD>If the <code>-l</code> switch is also present, a dialog will be provided that enables the specified <A HREF="glossary.htm#station_location">Station Location</A> to be edited;
otherwise, a dialog will be provided that enables a new Station Location to be defined.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><code>-u</code></TD>
<TD>Instead of saving the <A HREF="glossary.htm#signed_log_file">digitally signed log file</A>, upload it to LoTW over the Internet.<p>
<code>Return Codes<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;0&nbsp;&nbsp;success<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;1&nbsp;&nbsp;cancelled, or no action required<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;2&nbsp;&nbsp;rejected by LoTW server<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;3&nbsp;&nbsp;unexpected response from LotW server<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp;TQSL error<BR>
&nbsp;&nbsp;5&nbsp;&nbsp;TQSLLIB error (likely an invalid filename)<BR></code>
</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><code>-v</code></TD>
<TD>Display TQSL version information, and terminate.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><code>-x</code></TD>
<TD>Operate in batch mode: error messages and return codes will be routed to STDERR, and TQSL will terminate after taking the actions specified by command line options.</TD></TR>

<TR><TD><code>Filename</code></TD>
<TD>A command line option that is not a single-letter switch or the argument associated with a single-letter switch will be
considered the name of the ADIF or Cabrillo log file to be <A HREF="glossary.htm#signed_log_file">digitally signed</A> using the specified or selected Station Location. If the specified Filename 
contains embedded spaces, it must be quoted in a manner suitable for the operating system and shell that's being used.
If <code>-u</code> is present, the resulting signed log file will be uploaded to LoTW via the internet. Otherwise, the resulting signed log file will be saved in the Filename specified by the <code>-o</code> switch; 
if <code>-o</code> is not present, the resulting log file will be saved in the same directory as the log file using the <code>.tq8</code> extension, overwriting any
existing <code>.tq8</code> file of the same name.

<P>
<B>Examples:</B>
<P>
Without displaying the QSO date-range dialog and ignoring duplicate QSOs, digitally sign the &quot;cqww log.adi&quot; log file using the &quot;CQWW Portable&quot; Station Location, upload the digitally signed log file to LoTW, and then terminate:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>
  tqsl -d -u -a new -x -l "CQWW Portable" "cqww log.adi" 
</CODE>
<P>
Edit the &quot;Home&quot; station location before beginning menu-driven operation:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>
  tqsl -l Home -s
</CODE>
<P>
Add a station location, and then terminate:
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<CODE>
  tqsl -s -x
</CODE>
