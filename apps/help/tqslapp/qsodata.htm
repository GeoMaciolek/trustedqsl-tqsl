<H3>Managing QSO Data</H3>
<P>
<I>TQSL</I> contains a simple ADIF file creator and editor that can be used to
create small files that can then be signed as <i>TrustedQSL</i> files.
<P>
<TABLE BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=10 CELLSPACING=0 BGCOLOR="#E0E0FF">
<TR><TD><B>N.B.</B> The QSO Data editor in <I>TQSL</I> is quite
rudimentary, intended only as a means for those who do not
have access to a full-featured logging program to create
TrustedQSL files. The QSO Data editor
handles only the most critical QSO data fields. If you
load an ADIF file created by a logging program into the <I>TQSL</I>
QSO Data editor, then save the file, fields of the records
will likely be lost in the editing process.
<P>
Bottom line: Don't use the QSL Data editor to edit a file
generated by a logging program. Or if you do, save the
file into a new ADIF file, leaving the original file intact.
</TD></TR></TABLE>
<P>
Enter QSO data by selecting the <B>File</B> menu <B>Create New ADIF file</B> command.
That will display the <B>QSO Data</b> dialog:
<P>
<img src="qsodata.bmp" width="400" height="440" border="2">
<P>
This dialog allows you to enter the QSO data used in TrustedQSL files.

<P>
Once a QSO record is entered, you can add another by choosing the <B>Add QSO</B> button.
When more than one QSO record is present, you can use the arrow buttons to step through
the records. Note, though, that you cannot step away from a record that has an error in
it. This includes the blank record at the end if you have just clicked <B>Add QSO</B>.
<P>
You can delete a QSO record from the list via the <B>Delete</B> button.
<P>
Once the QSO records have been entered, click <B>Ok</B> to save them to an ADIF file
of your choice.
<P>
You also can edit an ADIF file you've saved. Choose <B>Edit existing ADIF file</b> from
the <b>File</b> menu. You'll be able to choose the file to edit, after which the
<b>QSO Data</b> dialog will appear containing the QSO records from that file.
<P>


<P>The following fields are required by
ARRL's <i>Logbook of the World</i> server to match your QSO:
<P>

<P><B>Call Sign</B>

<P>The call sign of the station worked.
<P>

<P><B>UTC Date (YYYY-MM-DD)</B>
<P>The QSO date in Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC, sometimes called GMT) must be entered in YYYY-MM-DD format
(e.g., 2002-08-11 for August 11, 2002).
<P>

<P><B>UTC Time (HHMM)</B>
<P>The QSO time in Coordinated Universal
Time (UTC, sometimes called GMT or Zulu time) can be entered in HHMM
or HH:MM format. Seconds may be used too (HHMMSS or HH:MM:SS).
<P>

<P><B>Mode</B>
<P>This list shows the modes recognized by
TrustedQSL. See the ADIF Modes tab in the Preferences section of the
File menu to create a mapping for modes not listed here.
<P>

<P><B>Band</B>
<P>This is the band that the QSO took
place on. In the case of crossband QSOs, this is the band that <I>your
station transmitted on</I>. All amateur bands from 137 kHz (2190
meters) through the millimeter waves are supported by TrustedQSL.
<P>

<P>The following fields are optional:
<P><B>RX Band</B>
<P>This field should be left blank unless
you are recording a crossband QSO (where you transmit on one band and
receive on another). In the case of crossband QSOs, this is the band
that <I>your station received on</I>. All amateur bands from 137 kHz
(2190 meters) through the millimeter waves are supported by
TrustedQSL.
<P>

<P><B>Frequency</B>
<P>This field allows you to enter the
exact frequency that the QSO took place on. It corresponds to the
Band field; in the case of crossband QSOs, this is the frequency that
<I>your station transmitted on</I>. Frequency is not required. In
fact, the contents of the frequency field are not checked at all.
Whatever you enter there will be placed into the ADIF file.
<P>

<P><B>RX Frequency</B>
<P>This field should be left blank unless
you are recording a crossband QSO (where you transmit on one band and
receive on another). It corresponds to the RX Band field. In the case
of crossband QSOs, this is the frequency that <I>your station
received on</I>. Frequency is not required. In fact, the contents of
the frequency field are not checked at all. Whatever you enter there
will be placed into the ADIF file.
<P>

<P><B>Propagation Mode</B>
<P>This field is used to record the
propagation mode used for the QSO, if known. It is used primarily to
distinguish among the various VHF/UHF propagation modes for those
awards that use the information. It is also used to designate
Satellite QSOs for DXCC, WAS, VUCC and other awards or endorsements
available for contacts via amateur satellites. <I>Note</I>: The
propagation modes listed on this menu are those found in the ADIF
specification and is not necessarily a complete list of all
possibilities.
<P>

<P><B>Satellite</B>
<P>If you have selected Satellite as the
Propagation Mode, you can use this field to select the specific
amateur satellite that you used for the QSO.
