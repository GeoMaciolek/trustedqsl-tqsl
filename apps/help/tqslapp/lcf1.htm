<H3>Loading a Certificate File - Results</H3>
<P>
When a certificate file has been loaded, the results of the operation are displayed:

<P>
Most certificate files used with <i>tQSLCert</i> actually contain three certificates: the user certificate (which
is your personal certificate) and two certificates used for verifying the issuer of
the user certificate.
<P>
In this example of loading a PKCS#12 file containing a user certificate, a CA
(certification authority) certificate and a root CA certificate, the user
certificate was loaded into the computer while the other two were found to be duplicates, meaning
they were already present on the computer. In addition, the file contained a
private key that was loaded.
<P>
<I>Note:</I> .tq6 files never contain private keys.
<P>
If the file you loaded was a TSQL (.tq6) certificate file, you may want to
<a href="save.htm">save</a> the newly loaded certificte and its private key in a PKCS#12 file. That
file then constitutes a complete backup of the information for the certificate.
Use the saved PKCS#12 file to load the certificate and key back into the system
if the certificate information is lost (due to a hard-drive crash, for example).
You also can load the PKCS#12 file into a separate computer if you need to be
able to sign data from more than one machine.
