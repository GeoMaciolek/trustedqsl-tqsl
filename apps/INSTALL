This is the TrustedQSL application suite, part of the TrustedQSL

4) Building the Applications under Windows.

===================================================================

1) Prerequisites

These applications require the tqsllib library. First build and
install that library and its prerequisites.

In the instructions that follow, the versions of other packages
that were used to build the TrustedQSL package as of the date this
document was last updated are given in parentheses.

These applications make use of the wxWindows/wxWidgets GUI
framework. (http://www.wxwindows.org/) Version 2.4.2 or later
is required. (2.5.x recommended for Mac OS X.) For Unix and
Mac OS X, follow the build instructions found there, or install
the wxWindows/wxWidgets packages appropriate for your platform.

Building under Windows also requires Inno Setup (version 3 or
later), http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php.

For Windows, the installable wxWindows package targets VC++.
It may be possible to build these applications under VC++,
but these instructions cover building the application under
the MSYS/MinGW environment used to build the tqsllib library.
(Note that to run the applications does *not* require any special
environment.)

===================================================================

2) Building the Applications under Linux/Unix

The quick answer:

./configure
make
make install

That will install the Applications under /usr/local/bin and the
initial configuration data under /usr/local/share/tqsl.

You can change the install location via:
./configure --prefix=/foo/bar

If you installed the tqsllib library or its dependent libraries
in locations that configure can't find, you'll need to specify
those locations to configure. See:

./configure --help

===================================================================

3) Building the Applications under Mac OS X

You'll need to have the Mac developer's tools, Xcode 1.5, installed.

This is done in much the same manner as building under Linux/Unix, above.
However, you ought *not* do "make install." Using Terminal, simply do:

./configure
make

This will result in the directories dist/TrustedQSL/tqsl.app and
tqslcert.app, which comprise complete Mac OS X applications. You
can simply move the dist/TrustedQSL folder to your system's
Applications folder or the location of your choice, then launch
the applications from Finder. If you want to distribute the built
applications:

make dmg

will make TrustedQSL-1.11.dmg, a Mac distributable disk image
containing the TrustedQSL applications folder and document files.

===================================================================

4) Building the Applications under Windows

Before you can build the applications under Windows you must
first build the tqsllib DLL. In doing so, you will set up the
MSYS/MinGW environment as needed.

STEP 1) Install needed other packages

Install wxWindows/WxWidgets [wxMSW] (2.4.2)

(The wxMSW installation suggests that you set an environment
variable, WXWIN, to the base directory of your installation.
The following directions assume you did that.)

Install Inno Setup (5.0.7)

STEP 2) Build the wxWindows/wxWidgets library

cd $WXWIN
mkdir build
cd build
../configure --disable-threads --with-msw --disable-shared --prefix=$HOME/wx
make install

STEP 3) Build the TrustedQSL applications

Note: If you installed Inno Setup in a location other that its
default, configure may need the --with-inno switch. For assistance,
see:

./configure --help

cd
tar -xzf TrustedQSL-1.11.tar.gz
cd TrustedQSL-1.11
./configure --without-openssl
make installer

This should result in a file, tqsl-111.exe. This is an executable
setup file that will install the TrustedQSL applications.
