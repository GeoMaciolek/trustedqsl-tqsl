QUICK-START
===========

Installation
============

In Windows, once the software is installed you'll find the TQSL program
under the Start/Programs/TrustedQSL menu. (Unless you selected a
different menu during installation.) The installer also lets you place
shortcuts to these programs on your desktop.

To install on Mac OS X, open the disk image file (.dmg) and drag the
TrustedQSL folder to your Applications folder. If you are replacing
an existing installation of TrustedQSL, you should choose "Replace All"
when prompted if the existing files should be replaced. You could also drag
the existing TrustedQSL folder to the trash first as no user data will be lost.

On a Mac OS X 10.8 or later system, you may need to grant permission for
the applications to run.  To do that, right click on the application icon,
then choose Open. You will receive an "Are you sure" dialog box. Click
the "Open" button to permit the application to open. You will only need
to do this once for a given TQSL release.

Instructions for installing on Linux can be found in the INSTALL document
included with the source code.


If you're updating an existing TQSL installation
================================================

This version of TQSL includes the functionality previously provided by TQSLCert,
so TQSLCert has been removed from your computer. Use the "Callsign Certificates" 
tab on TQSL's Main window.

By default, TQSLCert was configured to hide both "replaced" and "expired" 
certificates. TQSL displays all Callsign Certificates on its Main window's 
"Callsign Certificates" tab:

- "replaced" Certificates are denoted by an A=>B icon

- "expired" Certificates are denoted by an alarm clock icon. 

You should delete each "replaced" or "expired" Callsign Certificate by clicking 
its entry on the "Callsign Certificates" tab, and then selecting the "Callsign 
Certificate" menu's "Delete Callsign Certificate" command.


If you're installing TQSL for the first time
============================================

1) CREATE A CERTIFICATE REQUEST. Start TQSL. You'll get a message
reporting that you have no Callsign Certificates and asking if you want to
request one. Choose YES. Then proceed through the request wizard:

   a) The request wizard will ask you to supply a call sign. Use your
   present call sign -- without any portable identifiers.

   b) The QSO start date is the first date for which you'll enter QSO
   records into the system using the call sign you supply. Normally this is
   the issue date for your license. Leave the QSO end date blank for a
   license that is current.

   c) For US call signs, your mailing address should agree with the
   address in the FCC database. If your address is different, you must
   register your new address with the FCC.

   d) The request wizard includes a page that allows you to digitally
   sign the certificate request; on your initial request, you must choose
   "unsigned".

   e) If your computer is connected to the internet, TQSL will offer to submit
   your Callsign Certificate Request; choose YES. Otherwise, you'll be 
   prompted to save a .tq5 file, which you should then attach to an email 
   message to lotw-logs@arrl.org, or upload via the Web 
   (https://www.arrl.org/lotw/). 

   f) If you are a US licensee, you will receive a post card in the mail with
   further instructions; the post card will be sent to your address in the FCC
   database, so make sure that's correct! If you are a non-US licensee, you must
   submit proof of license and identity to receive your Callsign Certificate.
   See http://www.arrl.org/lotw/ for details.

NOTE! IT IS IMPORTANT that you NOT delete the Callsign Certificate Request (the 
red-lined "pending" icon) from TQSL's "Callsign Certificates" tab after the
request has been sent. Each Certificate Request is unique and must match
the Callsign Certificate that will be sent to you by the ARRL. If you direct TQSL
to delete the Certificate Request, you will not be able to load the Callsign 
Certificate the ARRL sends you in response.

3) LOAD THE CERTIFICATE. Your Callsign Certificate will arrive as a .TQ6 file
attached to an email message sent to the email address that you specified in
step 1. Using the same computer with which you generated the Callsign Certificate
Request, double-click the email attachment in the received message to launch 
TQSL and direct it to load the .TQ6 file; if that doesn't work, save the 
attached .tq6 file to a folder, run TQSL, and use its Callsign Certificate menu's 
"Load Callsign Certificate From File" command to load your Callsign Certificate;
this certificate will appear on the "Callsign Certificates" tab with a yellow 
medal icon indicating that it is "valid".

4) MAKE A BACKUP. This step is strongly recommended; if you fail to make a backup
and later lose your Callsign Certificate to a hard-drive crash or operating system
reinstallation, your Certificate will not be recoverable. Select the File menu's 
"Backup Station Locations, Certificates, and Preferences..." command, and create
a backup on a flash (thumb) drive, an external hard drive, or on a cloud storage
service like DropBox, Google Drive, or Microsoft Sky Drive.

5) REQUEST ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATES. Logbook of the World treats a call
sign with a portable identifier (e.g. NU1AW/4 or KP2/W1AW) as a separate
call sign. To submit QSOs using such a callsign, you need a
Callsign Certificate for that callsign. After you have received your
Callsign Certificate for your present call sign, repeat the process above, but in
step 1a specify your portable callsign, and in step 1d digitally sign the request
with the Callsign Certificate for your present callsign.

6) CREATE A LOG FILE. If you have a logging program that can produce log
files in ADIF or Cabrillo format, you can use those files directly. If
you just want to create a log file containing a few QSOs, start TQSL, select the
"Log Operations" tab, and click the "Create an ADIF file for signing and uploading"
button.

7) CREATE A STATION LOCATION. In TQSL, select the "Station Locations" tab and
click the "Create a new Station Location" button. Step through the wizard to 
specify the location of the station used to make the QSOs you'll be submitting. 
At the end of the wizard, enter a name that identifies this station location, 
e.g., "Home" or "Portable in EM29."

8) CREATE A SIGNED LOG SUBMISSION. In TQSL, select the "Station Locations" tab and
click the "Sign a log and upload it automatically to LoTW" button. In the 
"Select Station Location" dialog, select the station location and click "Ok"; TQSL
will upload your digitally signed QSOs over the internet to LotW.

9) Visit the LotW Web site at https://www.arrl.org/lotw/ to view your
submitted data and confirmations and apply for award credits; from TQSL, you can 
go there by clicking the "Log Operations" tab's "Log in to the Logbook of the World
Site" button.
