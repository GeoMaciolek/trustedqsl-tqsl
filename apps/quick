QUICK-START
===========

Once the software is installed you'll find the programs TQSLCert and
TQSL under the Start/Programs/TrustedQSL menu. (Unless you selected a
different menu during installation.) The installer also lets you place
shortcuts to these programs on your desktop.

1) CREATE A CERTIFICATE REQUEST. Run TQSLCert. You'll get a message
reporting that you have no certificates and asking if you want to
request one. Say YES. Then proceed through the request wizard, saving
the request into a file.

   a) The request wizard will ask you to supply a call sign. Use your
   licensed call sign -- without any portable identifiers.

   b) The QSO start date is the first date for which you'll enter QSO
   records into the system using the call sign you supply. Normally this is
   the issue date for your license. Leave the QSO end date blank for a
   license that is current.

   c) For US call signs, the mailing address should agree with the
   address in the FCC database.

   d) The request wizard includes a page that allows you to digitally
   sign the certificate request. On your initial request, you must choose
   "unsigned" since you have no certificate with which to sign.

   e) Remember which directory you save the certificate request file into
   for the next step!

2) SUBMIT THE CERTIFICATE REQUEST. Send the file created in step 1 as an
attachment in an email message to lotw-logs@arrl.org, or upload it via the
Web (https://www.arrl.org/lotw/). If you are a US licensee, you will
then receive a post card in the mail with further instructions. (The
post card will be sent to the address you have in the FCC database, so
make sure that's correct!) If you are a non-US licensee, you must submit
proof of license to receive your certificate. See
http://www.arrl.org/lotw/ for details.

NOTE! IT IS IMPORTANT that you do NOT delete the certificate request from
TQSLCert once it has been sent. Each certificate request is unique and must
match the certificate that will be returned to you by the issuer. If you
delete the certificate request from TQSLCert, you will NEVER be able to
load or use the received certificate!

3) LOAD THE CERTIFICATE. Once your certificate has been issued it will
be sent to the email address you entered into the certificate request
during step 1. You'll probably be able to double-click the attachment in
the received message to launch TQSLCert to import the certificate. If
that doesn't work, save the attachment to disk, run TQSLCert and use its
File menu's "Load Certificate File" command to load in the certificate
file. Once that's done, TQSLCert should show your certificate in its
certificate list.

4) SAVE THE CERTIFICATE. This step isn't required but is a very good
idea. If you do not perform this step and later lose your certificate
(due to a hard-drive crash or system reinstall, for example), your
certificate will be unrecoverable. Click on the certificate in the
certificate list to select it, then choose the Certificate menu's Save
command. Save the certificate file onto a floppy disk or other off-line
medium.

5) REQUEST ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATES. Logbook of the World treats a call
sign with a portable identifier (e.g. NT1N/9 or OE/NT1N) as a separate
call sign. To submit log data using such a call sign, you need a
certificate with that call sign in it. Once you have received your
initial certificate, repeat the process above, but in step 1d, sign the
request with the certificate you received and loaded. This will speed
the process of getting the certificate and will ensure that all of your
certificates appear under your Web site user account.

6) CREATE A LOG FILE. If you have a logging program that can produce log
files in ADIF or Cabrillo format, you can use those files directly. If
you just want to enter a few QSOs into a log file, you can run TQSL and
choose the File menu's "Create New ADIF file" command.

7) CREATE A STATION LOCATION. In TQSL, select "Station/Add Location"
from the menu. Step through the wizard to specify the location of the
station used to make the contacts you'll be submitting. (All entries in
the station location are optional, so you can leave them blank for
testing if you wish.) At the end of the wizard, enter a name to use for
this station location.

8) CREATE A SIGNED LOG SUBMISSION. In TQSL, select "Sign existing ADIF
or Cabrillo file" from the File menu. In the resulting "Select Station
Location" dialog, select the station location and click "Ok." You'll
then be asked to select the log file (a file in ADIF or Cabrillo format)
to sign. Finally, you'll be asked to specify the file to write the
signed log to.

9) SEND THE SUBMISSION. Send the file created in step 8 as an attachment
via email to lotw-logs@arrl.org. You will receive an email response.
(More than one file can be attached to an email message.) Or you can
upload the file at https://www.arrl.org/lotw/

10) Visit the LOTW Web site at https://www.arrl.org/lotw/ to view your
submitted data and confirmations and apply for award credits. Submit any
bug reports to lotw-help@arrl.org.
